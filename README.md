# Thermodynamic framework for mutant phenotype prediction

This work provides code and data to accompany the paper: *Thermodynamic framework for mutant fluxome prediction*


Data can be found in the case[x].mat files where x is {1,2,3}.

Main script is stored as main.m. This script compares four different mutant prediction algorithms using *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiaie* 13C MFA flux experimental data.

Full detials will be released once the paper is accepted.
